<% if plan_gets_a_gift(@donation.plan) && @donation.accept_gift %>
This donation is fully tax deductible and no goods or services were provided to the donor except for a small gift whose value will be approximated in your year-end receipt.
<% else %>
<% end %>

<% if donation_gets_a_gift(@donation) %>
Gift Delivery:

At the end of the year we'll total up all of your donations and/or payments on a subscription in 2017 and that will determine your membership level.

Then, if you've donated $64 or more we'll send you a secret code that you can redeem in our members-only store for your gift(s).

Your code will cover the entire cost of the suggested gifts for your membership level, but you can choose any gift(s) you'd like. You can also purchase additional items.

We certainly welcome donations less than $64, and we'll still send you a nice thank you note, and maybe a sticker or something. :)
